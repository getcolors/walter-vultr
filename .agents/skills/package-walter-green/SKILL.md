# A remote development machine, with Walter

Use this skill to initialize or operate a walter project in the user's current
directory. Walter provisions one machine, records it in `~/.ssh/config` so
`ssh <profile>` reaches it, and powers it off and on.

## Requirements

Babashka runs the launcher. `create` and `delete` also need OpenTofu and
Ansible. `stop` and `start` need the provider's power credentials.
`converge-nix` and `converge-asdf` need an already-created, running machine and
its managed SSH aliases, but no provider or backend credentials. With
`github-account` set, a real `create` also needs `gh` on the workstation — it
runs GitHub's device flow as its first action. Provider credentials use
`COLORS_PAR_*` variables, except OCI, which uses the profile named in
`~/.oci/config`, and S3, which uses OpenTofu's ambient AWS credential chain.

## Non-negotiable safety rules

- Never ask the user to paste a secret into chat.
- Never put API tokens, passwords, private keys or access keys in `colors.yml`,
  in the `green` launcher, in shell history, or in generated examples. Every
  credential arrives through a `COLORS_PAR_*` environment variable named after
  the key it fills. Suggest a gitignored `.envrc.private`, never an inline
  export a shell history records.
- Public SSH keys are not secrets; private ones are. `oci-ssh-authorized-keys`
  holds the **path** to a public-key file that OpenTofu reads at plan time —
  record the path, never inline the contents, and never read a private key.
  By default walter generates and manages the machine keypair
  `~/.ssh/<profile>`; never read or move those files either.
- With `github-account` set, a real `create` starts by printing a one-time
  code and waiting — up to about fifteen minutes — for the user to approve it
  at https://github.com/login/device. That is the design, not a hang: the
  workflow is interactive at the beginning only. Relay the code and URL to the
  user and wait; never try to acquire, read, or echo the token itself.
- **Never set `COLORS_PAR_PROFILE`.** Walter refuses to run when it is set, and
  suggesting it as a workaround defeats the guard. The profile identifies the
  project, and the project is the directory. If the user wants a different
  profile, edit `colors.yml`.
- Do not overwrite an existing `green` launcher or `colors.yml` without
  explicit approval. If a project is already valid, operate it rather than
  regenerating it.
- Default to `build` and `create --dry-run`. Run a real `create` or `delete`
  only after the user confirms that exact operation.
- `build` and `create --dry-run` are credential-free by design and check no
  `COLORS_PAR_*` at all. A clean dry-run says nothing about whether real
  provisioning would authenticate; never report it as credential validation.
- Before `delete`, remind the user that a development machine holds uncommitted
  work and that the boot volume goes with it. `compute-prevent-destroy` defaults
  to `true`; authorize an intentional delete with
  `COLORS_PAR_COMPUTE_PREVENT_DESTROY=false` rather than editing desired state.
- Never edit anything under `.colors/` — it is generated output.

Read [references/configuration.md](references/configuration.md) before
generating or changing desired state, and before any real `create` or `delete`.

## Commands

```sh
./green build              # render .colors/<profile>/ only; contacts nothing
./green create --dry-run   # print the graph; touches nothing
./green create             # provision, and write the ssh config block
./green stop               # power off
./green start              # power on, and refresh the ssh config block
./green converge-nix       # update declared Nix entries on every login
./green converge-asdf      # install declared asdf versions on every login
./green delete             # destroy, dropping the ssh block first
```

`-f/--file` overrides the `colors.yml` found by walking up from the working
directory.

## Initialize in the current directory

1. Copy the `green` payload beside this file into the project root and
   `chmod +x` it.
2. Write `colors.yml`. Ask for the provider first, then only the keys that
   provider needs — `references/configuration.md` lists them.
3. **Choose a `profile` unique to this project**, conventionally the directory
   name. It names the work directory, the OpenTofu state keys and the ssh alias.
   Two projects sharing a profile and a state bucket address the same state,
   which is how a development machine ends up managing a production server.
4. Ask whether the machine should have the user's GitHub identity. If so, set
   `github-account` to their login and `git-email` to their commit email, and
   tell them a real `create` will start with a one-time device-flow code to
   approve from a browser. This is required before offering
   `emacs-config-repo`, `clone-orgs` or `dotfiles-checkout` — their clones
   authenticate through it.
5. The machine-access keypair needs no collection: walter generates a
   profile-named keypair by default (SSH Keypair Standard). Only when the
   user wants their own key, collect the provider's machine-key value.
6. Ask whether the user wants their Emacs configuration on the machine. If so,
   set `emacs-config-repo` to its **https** git URL (`git@`/`ssh://` forms are
   refused) and `emacs-config-dest` to where it must live — the default is
   `~/.config/emacs`, and a configuration expecting another path needs
   `--init-directory` to reach it. Leave both out otherwise; the rendered
   playbook then does not mention Emacs.
7. Run `./green build` and show the user what was rendered.

## What create puts on the machine

Every machine gets **nix**, a **Ghostty terminfo entry**, and kernel networking
settings for unprivileged `cloudflared`, unconditionally. The sysctls allow the
login user's primary group to use ping sockets and raise QUIC's receive/send
buffer ceilings, so a tunnel should run without sudo or those warnings. Tell
the user about nix rather than proposing walter changes for other tooling: once
it is there, anything else is `nix profile install` and needs nothing from
walter.

The terminfo is why `Terminal type xterm-ghostty is not defined` does not
happen. If a user reports that error — from `vim`, `top`, `less` or Emacs — on a
machine created before this existed, the fix is to re-run `create`, not to
change `TERM`. For a terminal walter does not cover, the one-liner is:

```sh
infocmp -x "$TERM" | ssh <alias> -- tic -x -
```

With `github-account` set, `create` also logs the machine's own gh in with the
token the device flow minted, makes it git's https credential helper, and
configures the commit identity — every clone below authenticates through it,
and nothing of the workstation's (no key, no agent) is involved. A machine
already logged in skips the interactive step entirely, so re-creates stay
unattended.

With `emacs-config-repo` set, `create` also installs Emacs (a full build from a
pinned nixpkgs) and clones the configuration over https with the machine's own
token — no private key is written to the machine, and the checkout can push
back. The clone happens **once**; a later `create` leaves an existing one alone,
so work done on the machine is never discarded. Offer `git pull` on the machine
rather than a re-run when the user wants the config refreshed.

Emacs packages are not pre-fetched. The first `emacs` launch fetches from
ELPA/MELPA, native-compiles and clones tree-sitter grammars, which takes minutes
and is expected. Do not report it as a provisioning failure.

`nix` and `emacs` reach `PATH` via `/etc/profile.d/nix.sh`, a **login** shell
mechanism: `ssh walter-oci` sees them, `ssh walter-oci emacs …` as a one-shot
command does not.

## Focused tooling convergence

`converge-nix` and `converge-asdf` operate only on an existing, running machine.
They use `ssh <profile>` and every `ssh <profile>-<seat>` alias, never OpenTofu
state or a provider API. If an alias or prerequisite binary is absent, run
`create`; if the machine is stopped, run `start`.

`converge-nix` ensures every `nix-packages` entry exists, resolves the profile
elements Walter owns from `nix profile list --json`, and advances only stale
declared elements to the current `nixpkgs-unstable`. It preserves unrelated
packages installed by the user and does not remove a former declaration.

`converge-asdf` adds missing plugins, installs the exact `asdf-tools` versions,
sets them for the home, and repeats Corepack enable/reshim so a Node change does
not make pnpm disappear. It never chooses `latest` on its own.

Both commands support `--dry-run`, and every task is safe to run again.
`converge-asdf` reports no change once its exact versions are converged.
`converge-nix` reports a change when Nix advances an element; that flag follows
Nix's current `upgrading ` wording, so an upstream rewording can misreport the
flag without changing what is installed.

## Stopping and starting

The colors-compute library coordinates OCI and Vultr power operations using
the immutable ID from owned remote node state. Both need a reachable state
backend; unsupported providers refuse. An uncertain action retains ownership
coordination for recovery. Start waits for a running state, reads the current
public address, then refreshes SSH aliases. It does not recreate the VM.

OCI uses its configured CLI profile; Vultr uses COLORS_PAR_VULTR_API_KEY.
Power billing depends on the provider and storage remains allocated.

## When something fails

- **`COLORS_PAR_PROFILE is set`** — the user has it exported, probably from
  another project's `.envrc`. Unset it; do not work around it.
- **`required credential is not set: COLORS_PAR_X`** — name the variable and let
  the user export it themselves.
- **Compute ownership or power refused** — inspect backend connectivity and
  the owned deployment journal. Do not set an instance-ID override or treat an
  unreadable state as absent. Legacy monolithic state requires explicit migration.
- **`gh auth login failed`** — `gh` is missing on the workstation, or the
  one-time code expired unapproved. Install gh or re-run `create` and approve
  the code; there is no token to paste anywhere.
- **A create failed after the code was approved** — just re-run it. The minted
  token survives under `~/.local/state/walter/github-token-<profile>` for
  exactly this, so the retry does not prompt again; it is removed once a
  create seeds the machine.
- **the login approved the code as X but colors.yml names github-account Y** —
  the user approved from the wrong GitHub account. Re-run `create` and approve
  from the account the machine is meant to act as, or fix `github-account`.
- **A contract mismatch** — the pinned commit is older than this launcher.
  Re-copy `green` from an updated skill; nothing inside the project fixes it.
- **Focused convergence reports that a host key changed** — unlike create,
  `converge-nix` and `converge-asdf` deliberately keep SSH host-key checking
  enabled. For the narrow same-address/different-key case after a rebuild, run
  `ssh-keygen -R <address-from-the-error>` and retry. Use the address SSH names,
  not the managed alias; every seat shares that address. Hashed `known_hosts`
  entries cannot be repaired reliably by eye.
